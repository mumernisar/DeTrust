# DeTrust

## Note

This project is planned for development in future.

## Overview

DeTrust is a decentralized escrow platform designed to facilitate secure exchanges of digital assets, such as game keys and software licenses, while minimizing the need for intermediaries. Utilizing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, DeTrust ensures trustless transactions and addresses potential disputes through a decentralized arbitration mechanism.

### Key Features

- **Smart Contract Escrow**: An automated escrow system that securely holds digital assets and cryptocurrency until both parties confirm the completion of the transaction.
- **Dispute Resolution System**: A structured process for resolving disputes that allows users to submit evidence and leverage a decentralized arbitration service for fair outcomes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive front-end built with React.js, making it easy for buyers and sellers to navigate the platform and execute transactions.
- **Integration with IPFS**: Decentralized storage of digital assets ensures data integrity and accessibility while maintaining user privacy.
- **Reputation Mechanism**: A system that encourages trustworthy behavior among users, fostering a secure trading environment.

## Dispute Resolution Strategies

### 1. Verification Mechanism

To address the need for the buyer to verify the product while preventing immediate access to the actual asset, consider implementing a verification mechanism:

- **Time-Limited Access**: Allow the buyer a time-limited window (e.g., a few hours) to test the key. If the buyer verifies that it works, the contract automatically releases the payment. If the buyer claims it does not work, the dispute resolution process is initiated.

#### Claim and Response Process:

- The buyer tests the key and submits a claim regarding its functionality.
- If the buyer claims the key didn’t work, they must provide evidence of the error message or issues encountered during activation.

### 2. Escrow Smart Contract Logic

Use an escrow smart contract that holds both the Steam key and the currency until verification is completed:

- **Deposit Functionality**: The buyer deposits cryptocurrency into the smart contract while the seller deposits the Steam key (hashed or encrypted, if necessary) without revealing it.
- **Test Phase**: The buyer attempts to redeem the key. If successful, they confirm it within the DApp, which triggers the release of funds.

### 3. Dispute Claims Process

If a dispute arises, implement a structured dispute resolution process:

- **Dispute Initiation**:
  - If the buyer claims the key didn’t work, they initiate a dispute through the DApp. The contract enters a dispute state where neither the funds nor the key is released.
- **Evidence Submission**:

  - Both parties (the buyer and seller) can submit evidence:
    - **Buyer**: Provide screenshots or error messages when trying to redeem the key.
    - **Seller**: Provide evidence of the key’s authenticity (e.g., purchase receipt or a transaction hash from a trusted source indicating the key is legitimate).

- **Arbitration**:
  - Use a decentralized arbitration mechanism (like Kleros or Aragon Court) to resolve the dispute. Arbitrators will review the evidence submitted by both parties and make a judgment.
- **Outcome**:

  - Based on the evidence, the arbitrator decides whether to release the funds to the seller or return them to the buyer.

- **Multi-Signature Contract (Optional)**:
  - Consider using a multi-signature approach where a small group of trusted participants must approve the release of funds based on the dispute resolution outcome.

### 4. Reputation System

Incorporate a reputation system to encourage fair behavior:

- **Feedback and Ratings**:
  - After the transaction, allow both parties to leave feedback. Good actors build a positive reputation, while bad actors might face penalties or reduced trustworthiness in future transactions.
- **Stakeholder Voting**:
  - In cases of disputes, a small group of users can act as jurors who vote on the outcome, helping to mitigate unfair claims.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum
- **Smart Contract Language**: Solidity
- **Frontend**: React.js, Web3.js
- **Storage**: IPFS
- **Development Tools**: Foundry

## Conclusion

DeTrust represents a robust solution for secure digital asset transactions, balancing user verification and dispute resolution within a decentralized framework. This project not only enhances trust in online exchanges but also showcases innovative applications of blockchain technology to improve user experience and security.
